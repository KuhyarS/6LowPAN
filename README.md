 An implementation of 6LowPAN protocol for transmission of IPv6 over low power WPAN (IEEE 802.15.4) networks.
compatible with Contiki OS. also it contain's IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer framer code integrated.

This code can be used in network simulator apps or for driver development on any platform UNIX/FreeBSD/Windows/Linux ...
for example on freeBSD driver developmet you can use #define FREEBSD before incliding headers and use it with ease.

you can see main.c file for written test cases and know how to use the library.

Since the library is not complete and prefect I will wellcome contribution's and/or advices if any ;)
